Procedural steps for opening and testing DailyCodingProblems in C++

-- Startup sequence
ProblemSelector class should handle a request to open a specified problem
1) Selector should accept input of problem name
2) If name matches existing problem -> open that problem (ExistingProblemInitializer)
3) If name does not match -> prompt to create new problem (NewProblemInitializer)
4) If no name was provided display a list of all problems for user to select

-- Existing problem was selected
ExistingProblemInitializer class should be able to
1) open the selected problem file in VS code to edit
2) compile and run the selected problem

-- New problem name was provided
NewProblemInitializer class should handle a request to create a new problem
1) create a source code file with a properly formatted file name
